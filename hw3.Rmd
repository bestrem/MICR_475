I wanted to investigate the relationship between Murder, rape, and the size of the urban population. This plot suggests that Murder and Rape have a positive, linear relationship. It also suggests that UrbanPop does not strongly correlate to murder rates but is more correlated to rape.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
head(USArrests, 10)
ggplot(data=USArrests)+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = Murder, y = Rape, size = UrbanPop))
```
